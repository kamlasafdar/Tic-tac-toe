# Tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe Game Description
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe showdown between a player and a machine! To decide who gets the first move, a classic coin toss will take place, with heads or tails determining the lucky contender.

The coin is tossed, and let's say it lands on heads. If the player called heads and wins the toss, they will have the honor of making the initial move. On the other hand, if the machine's call matches the outcome, it seizes the opportunity to go first.

Once the turn order is established, the game begins. The player and the machine take alternating turns, strategically placing their respective symbols on the Tic Tac Toe board in a quest for victory.

May the best tactician triumph in this timeless battle of Xs and Os!
